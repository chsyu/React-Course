The original Dot stool design was realized in 1954 by Arne Jacobsen and Fritz Hansen. This is an updated version of the classic, now with a sustainable twist: it utilizes the same high-quality leather as the design icons Ã„gget and Svanen for its luxurious and comfortable seat. Three braces on the bottom serve as convenient footrests while also providing additional stability. The High Dot stool is perfect for a high desk or kitchen island and makes for a striking interior detail in any design-conscious home.",
